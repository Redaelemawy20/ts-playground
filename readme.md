# Typescript Playground

This main goal of this repository is for learning purposes and to test typescript use cases and advanced workarounds.

The repository will cover the following topics:

-  build a loose auto-complete feature in typescript
-  dynamic function arguments with generic types
-  conditional types to create a generic function that can extract a sub-set of a union type

 The project is being built and tested using typescript 5.8.3 and node 22.14.0.
